CleanMyDesktop
==============

Just an Idea I had for taking care of stuff on my desktop.

We all do it. We put crap on our desktop. Yeah, there are better places for it. But if you're like me, once something is out of sight you forget about it.

So they sit there. On your desktop reminding you that there is still something you need to check out.

Goals
-----
 - Possibly have an "age" setting. Might want a file on your desktop for 30 minutes, like a temp directory.
 - Put things in the right spot - or at least another spot. (Notes in a notes folder. Bookmarks in a bookmarks folder, Application shortcuts - delete those, but remind you to take a look again, etc.).
 - A note that goes with the file as to why it's there (Hey, you put this shortcut on your desktop - why?).
 - A Reminder - to remind you to take a look again (With Snooze).
 - A Random Option - Waiting for something, have the system show you something you haven't seen in awhile.
 - A Hackable rules processing. I don't know what you want, nor do I care. Create a base, but you change it.

That's it for now.
